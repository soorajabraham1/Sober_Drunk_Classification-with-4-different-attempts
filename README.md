# Sober_Drunk_Classification-with-4-different-attempts
Here i try to classify the faces of people based on sober or drunk. 
I compare different classifiation algorithms such as logistic regression, Random forest and Gradient Boost.
In the first method, I diretly tried train using entire dataset without cleaning it.
Seond I cleaned the dataset and tried to classify into 4 classes.
Third, I considered 0 Glasses wine and one glass wine as sober and 2 glass wine and 3 glass wine a s drunk and trained without cleaninmg the dataset.
finally,I considered 0 Glasses wine and one glass wine as sober and 2 glass wine and 3 glass wine a s drunk and trained with cleaned dataset.
